Notes
This document is for informal notes about things I have realized, or should do. 
It will also contain results/comparisons of models as I add them.

-It has just dawned on me that this credit default data set is
a binary classification task. As such, we need a method for assigning
the linear models best guess to 0 or 1. Per ESL, we would assign one column of Y
to each class and then take the argmax of the prediction. So, I need a function for
converting the data. 
-DONE Add functionality for training and test data seperation
-Add ridge regression and logisitc regression and compare to OLS
-OLS: Train error: 0.1998  -  Test error: 0.2083

-Split off main file into a general file which will contain general funtions e.g. 
train/test split, data loading, data cleaning, etc
-Created methods folder to hold individual methods
-Created OLS, ridge, and logisitic files for their individual implementations
